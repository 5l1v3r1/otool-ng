This is a fork from Apple's otool with my personal modifications to otool.

Otool is one of my favourite reversing tools since I work a lot from Terminal.app.
The introduction of LC_MAIN as replacement for LC_UNIXTHREAD lost the entrypoint address information.
Now you need to calculate the address, which is a another step and I'm too lazy for that!

I also modified the output of some fields to hexadecimal values because I also hate to convert
those values all the time.

If you have any suggestions or improvements feel free to contact me, send patches, etc.

Enjoy,
fG!
